Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews of Sensitive Toothpastes

# Problem Statement:
- Nowadays, consumers are more vocal more they've ever been. Companies are curious to understand what consumers say in their reviews. In this project, I use Natural Language Processing techniques, including Word2Vec model and Classification Models to understand sentiments in consumer reviews. Data I used is Amazon Product review data for sensitive toothpastes. 
- XGBoost with Word2Vec model reached 93% accuracy and 92% weighted F1 score.
