# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews of Toothpastes

# Problem Statement:
- Nowadays, consumers are more vocal more they've ever been. Companies are curious to understand what consumers say in their reviews. In this project, I use Natural Language Processing techniques, including Word2Vec model and Classification Models to understand sentiments in consumer reviews. Data I used is 25716 rows of Amazon Product review data for sensitive toothpastes. 
- XGBoost with Word2Vec model reached 93% accuracy and 92% weighted F1 score.

# About this Project:
- In this project, I examined supervised methods of sentiment analysis, and used Word2Vec model to tranform texts to numercial formats.
- As in real life, many reviews do not come with labels, unsupervised methods are also included
Workflows of the project:
Part 1. Data Exploration and Preparation
Part 2. Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob, Vader
