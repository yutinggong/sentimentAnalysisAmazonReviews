# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews of Toothpastes

# Problem Statement:
- Nowadays, consumers are more vocal they've ever been. Companies are curious to understand what consumers say in their reviews. In this project, I use Natural Language Processing techniques, including Word2Vec model and Classification Models to understand sentiments in consumer reviews. In this project, I used 25,716 rows of Amazon Product review data of sensitive toothpastes. 
- XGBoost with Word2Vec model reached 93% accuracy and 92% weighted F1 score.

# About this Project: 
Please read [Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews.ipynb](https://github.com/yutinggong/sentimentAnalysisAmazonReviews/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20Amazon%20Reviews.ipynb) for code and more details.
- In this project, I examined supervised methods of sentiment analysis, and used Word2Vec model to tranform texts to numercial formats.
- As in real life, many reviews do not come with labels, unsupervised methods are therefore also included
